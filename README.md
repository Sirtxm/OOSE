# ATM Simulation Project

This project is a simulation of an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system, designed to demonstrate the application of object-oriented principles in software development. The program models real-world ATM operations such as account management, withdrawals, deposits, and balance inquiries.

## About
The ATM simulation project showcases how object-oriented design principles can be applied to build a robust and scalable system. It includes the following core functionalities:
- User authentication.
- Basic banking transactions (withdrawals, deposits, and balance inquiries).
- Account management features.

This project is part of the Object-Oriented Software Engineering (OOSE) coursework.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure login using account credentials.
- **Account Management:** Manage account balance and perform transactions.
- **Error Handling:** Proper error messages for invalid inputs or transactions.
- **Modular Design:** Implements OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
